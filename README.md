The objective of this project is to learn and practice the framework "laravel". This little personal project has no other ambitions.

-   it manages a sports betting system (teams, countries, competitions, bettors, etc.)
-   only by apis (I also have to learn the frontend)
-   and in particular: apiResources, relationships between models, form validations, resources, authorizations/permissions.

Can you give me your opinion on this work please ? It is very important for me to know in which level I can be. I specify that I am not a professional developer, but just an amateur passionate about development.

Is this work "pro", "normal", "not terrible"?

Thank you for your feedback

Dominique
